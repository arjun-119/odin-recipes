<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the
  classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect
  golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full
  flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.
